# EC2 Lab Example: Launching and Managing Instances

## Objectives

- Launch EC2 instance with termination protection
- Modify security group for HTTP access
- Monitor instance
- Resize instance
- Test termination protection
- Terminate instance

## Steps (Summary)

1. Launched Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with termination protection enabled
2. Modified security group â†’ added inbound rule for HTTP (port 80)
3. Verified access via browser
4. Monitored CPU & status checks in CloudWatch
5. Stopped and resized instance type
6. Disabled termination protection, then terminated instance

The instance has associated security groups and can be accessed via HTTP port 80">

## Key Takeaways

- EC2 instances can be scaled and protected from accidental termination
- Security groups define inbound/outbound rules
- Monitoring is built-in via CloudWatch
- Resize is flexible but requires stopping the instance
